# Catch of the Day
A mock seafood marketplace app built with React.

Users start by loading the pre-set fish inventory with a click of a button and/or create their own fish to add.

The user may then add the fish(es) of their choice to their order list.

The quantity of fish are added and the total cost is updated based on the fish and quantity.

Users can also remove fish from their order or remove fish from the inventory.
